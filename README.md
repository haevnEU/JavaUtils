# JavaUtils

During previous projects, I often found myself writing the same code repeatedly.
As a result, I've decided to start a small utility project to gather all these useful methods and classes in one place.

Since this is a personal project, I cannot guarantee that all methods work as expected or are free of bugs.
You may use this project at your own risk, and I am not liable for any issues that may arise.

The project is open source and available for free under the GPL-3.0 license.
If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a new issue.
Let me know if you'd like to contribute to this project.
